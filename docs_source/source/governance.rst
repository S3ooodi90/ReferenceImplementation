The S3Model project was created by Data Insights, Inc. based on years of research and development in semantic interoperability in healthcare IT. 

This solution has been generalized for any domain and is now used as the reference information model for a data-centric, model first approach to provide a foundation for structured, linked data driven by executable models. 

The specifications and reference model implementation are controlled and licensed by Data Insights, Inc.
