Specifications & Reference Implementation
------------------------------------------

The S3Model project was created by Data Insights, Inc. based on years of research and development in semantic interoperability in healthcare IT. Other domains were then considered and the approach was generalized to produce the current Reference Model and specifications documents.

The specifications and reference model implementation are controlled and licensed by Data Insights, Inc.
