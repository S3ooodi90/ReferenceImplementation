=============
Eclipse Ecore
=============

There is now an Eclipse Ecore model included in the documentation.
If people find it useful please expand on it. I have very little experience with Eclipse.

I could really use some help making this more useful.  Maybe you can even generate a Java code base from it?   Maybe you can edit DM models in it?  Maybe you can generate Python code?  I have no idea ...

Everything should be there.

If you can help with using this Ecore model to 'do something' please let me know.
