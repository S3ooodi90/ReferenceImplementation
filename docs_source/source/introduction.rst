Introduction
============

The Shareable, Structured, Semantic Model (S3Model) specifications are based on years of research and development. 

**S3Model is the foundation for your modern, data-centric information management systems**. 

**The S3Model approach allows domain experts to build the data model they need for their application and the shared models are the basis for a data-centric, model driven information management strategy. This sharable information model allows any data consumer to determine if the data is correct for their needs.**

The above paragraph describes the foundation of *data-centric, model driven, computable semantic interoperability* in S3Model implementations. To be successful with implementing and creating systems with the full value of S3Model based applications it is important to understand the core concepts as laid out in the :doc:`Modeling Concepts <./modeling_concepts>` document. 

We provide complete training and tooling to make your transition from a legacy application-centric business to modern data-centric, AI driven enterprise.
