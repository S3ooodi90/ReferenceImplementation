S3Model is a solution to a foundational problem in managing the context of data to produce information. The problems lies in the ability to communicate the full meaning of data, as information between applications. Irregardless of the function of that application, as well as the physical and temporal distance from the original data collection. 

In this regard, it is best to explain the value proposition of a data-centric, model-first approach via illustrative use cases.
