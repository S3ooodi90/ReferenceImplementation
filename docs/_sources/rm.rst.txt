The Reference Implementation - Reference Model
==============================================

S3Model may be implemented in most (any?) programming or data definition languages.

The **reference implementation** is in XML Schema. This is due to the ubiquitous nature of XML and the compatibility with RDF/XML and OWL for datatyping.


Virtually all modern programming and data analysis languages can manipulate and validate XML content.

The *catalog* system in XML solves many issues around namespacing and network latency by allowing local persistence of schemas and documents referenced at remote locations.
