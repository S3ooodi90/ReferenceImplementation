The transformation rules that are used in the XSD to RDF/OWL algorithm are provided in the following table:

xs:simpleType   rdfs:Datatype with the suffix “Datatype” on datatype name.

xs:simpleType with xs:enumeration   rdfs:Datatype with the suffix “Datatype” on datatype name.In addition, for the enumerations, an owl:Class as a subclass of EnumeratedValue is created. Instances are created for every enumerated value. An instance of Enumeration, referring to all the instances, is created as well as the owl:oneOf union over the instances. These are mostly informative, as they are not used directly during the XML data to RDF/OWL transformation.

xs:complexType over xs:complexContent   owl:Class

xs:complexType over xs:simpleContent    owl:Class

xs:element (global) with complex type   owl:Class and subclass of the class generated from the referenced complex type

xs:element (global) with simple type    owl:Datatype

xs:element (local to a type)    owl:DatatypeProperty or owl:ObjectProperty depending on the element type. OWL Restrictions are built for the occurrence.

xs:group    owl:Class

xs:attributeGroup   owl:Class

Substitution Groups     Subclass statements are generated for the members.
