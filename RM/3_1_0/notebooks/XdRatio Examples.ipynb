For that, he would have to know, for a specific period of time, the total number of items purchased in the shop and the number of customer visits (customers that bought something) the shop had in the same period of time. If he sold 15,000 items and had 5,000 customers, the results will be:\n",

    "Thus, each customer buys in average 3 items each visit to the shop.\n",

    "Another common type of rate is counting the events occurred in individuals and using a person-time denominator. When the population of individuals is dynamic, i.e., the individuals can enter and exit the population at any time during the observation, it is wrong to count the individuals as units with the same weight. One individual that stays in the population the whole period of observation should be weighted more than another individual that stays just half of the period of observation.\n",

A worker that worked the whole month counts 30 worker-days. A worker that was admitted on the 15th day of the month counts 15 worker-days. A worker that got fired on the 10th day of the month counts 10 worker-days. To create the denominator all the individual worker-days are summed together.\n",
