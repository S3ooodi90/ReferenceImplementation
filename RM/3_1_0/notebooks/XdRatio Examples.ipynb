For that, he would have to know, for a specific period of time, the total number of items purchased in the shop and the number of customer visits (customers that bought something) the shop had in the same period of time. If he sold 15,000 items and had 5,000 customers, the results will be:\n",

    "Another common type of rate is counting the events occurred in individuals and using a person-time denominator. When the population of individuals is dynamic, i.e., the individuals can enter and exit the population at any time during the observation, it is wrong to count the individuals as units with the same weight. One individual that stays in the population the whole period of observation should be weighted more than another individual that stays just half of the period of observation.\n",

A worker that got fired on the 10th day of the month counts 10 worker-days. To create the denominator all the individual worker-days are summed together.\n",

    "Rates are ratios, proportions are ratios, but not all ratios are rates and proportions. Rates are a special case of ratios, and proportions are a special case of rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Odds are ratios, but odds are not rates or proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you could see from the examples, in the real world, rates and ratios are usually time and space constrained. \n",

    "Thinking about the examples shown, the results are only informative if you know of which place we are talking about and when the research was done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds example: a horse called Beautiful Sunset in the Sky during the 2016 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate example 1: Bloomingdale’s in NY in December 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rate example 2: the Home Depot in Jacksonville, TN, on March 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion example: US midterms in 2018 in the state of Minnesota. \n",
