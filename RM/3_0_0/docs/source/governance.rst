Specifications & Reference Implementation
------------------------------------------

The S3Model project was originally started by four individuals with a desire to build an openly available approach to true syntactic interoperability as well as computable semantic interoperability for global healthcare IT.

The founding agreement signed by these four guarantees that the S3Model specifications documents and the reference implementation will be published under open content and open source licenses.

The S3Model project is a meritocracy. Anyone may participate in the community which uses the `Google Plus <http://goo.gl/EoLGJM>`_ social network community for discussions. It is a private community only for the sake of SPAM reduction. No requests to join will be denied. However, SPAMMING the community with off-topic content will get you banned immediately, without notice.
You can also find us (occasionally) on the IRC network, Freenode channel #S3Model.

The complete governance guidelines and Contributor License Agreement (CLA) can be found in the repository in the document S3Model_governance_model.pdf found in the downloaded specs Documents directory. They are also available under the Documents section of the S3Model web site.

Other Artifacts
---------------
Governance of knowledge models is a local user issue.  Where local user can be defined as an individual or a nation.  In other words, governance of DMs is up to the modeler and or their governing body.  The S3Model team does not control these models.  As a modeler you may create them and share them (or not) as you wish.

The point that must be re-iterated here are:

 * that the source DM is expressed in an XML Schema 1.1 file and is valid against one S3Model Reference Model schema.
 * the PCMs (complexTypes) are named in accordance witht he specifications using a Type4 UUID and preceeded with the string 'pcm-'.

 The DM-Gen maintained by the S3Model team does have its own governance policies.
