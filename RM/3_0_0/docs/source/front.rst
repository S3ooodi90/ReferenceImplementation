Purpose & Scope
---------------
*Keep everything as simple as possible; but no simpler. â€“ Albert Einstein*

The purpose of the S3Model project is to provide a free and openly available specification for implementation of computable semantic interoperability for information exchange.
The S3Model specifications are designed to provide semantic interoperability that is fully independent of any implementation specific contexts. Therefore workflow, security, user access, data persistence, etc. are all outside the scope of S3Model.

The S3Model site on `GitHub <https://github.com/S3Model>`_ contains a growing number of demonstration projects and tools that research how this approach and focused scope enables interoperability across many contexts. S3Model based data can be exchanged via any transport method. Including existing HL7 v.2 and v.3 exchange systems to enhance the semantic interoperability of existing HL7 implementations.

Conformance
-----------
Conformance to these specifications are represented in a Language Implementation Specification (LIS). A LIS is a formal document detailing the mappings and conventions used in relation to these specifications.
A LIS is in direct conformance to these specifications when;

1. All datatypes are defined and mapped.
2. The value spaces of the healthcare datatypes used by the entity to be identical to the value spaces specified herein.
3. To the extent that the entity provides operations other than movement or translation of values, define operations on the healthcare datatypes which can be derived from, or are otherwise consistent with the characterizing operations specified herein.

Compliance
----------
These specifications;
* Are in indirect conformance with ISO/DIS 21090/2008.
* Are in compliance with applicable sections of ISO 18308/2008.
* Are in compliance with applicable sections of ISO/TR 20514:2005.
* Are in compliance with applicable sections of ISO 13606-1:2007.
* Are in conformance with W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1

Availability
------------

The S3Model specifications, reference implementation and tools are available from `Data Insights, Inc. <http://www.datainsights.tech>`_
